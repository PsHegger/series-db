# Why?

This application is for experimenting. I found myself multiple times in the position where I wanted to try out some new architecture ideas or a new library but our production applications were too big and complex for a simple experiment.
In this case I often wrote a small test application for it, but in many cases they we're too far from a real world example and using that knowledge learnt from that wasn't enough for a real world product.

That's why this application was created: to have an application which isn't too complex, but contains enough parts of a production app to find the pitfalls while experimenting with it.

I'm planning to keep the master branch as a base, it will only contain bugfixes, and in the mean time every branch will be a separate experiment. I also encourage you to fork it and use it for your own ideas.
